project 1

# Theme
The theme was going to be 'earth porn' or 'beauty in nature', but getty images didn't have anything particularly beautiful,
and suprise, searching for tweets with the word 'porn' as part of the query yeilded searches that are
not classroom appropriete xD.
The theme is still earth porn, except that searches use the keywords 'sunset', 'ocean', and 'mountain' for images, and
the search words 'protect environment', 'motherearth', and 'clean energy' for twitter.

With both APIs I did very basic searches, relying heavely on the search phrase instead of other parameters.
I chose my theme because it is broad, and lends itself to interperation, meaning my searches could be less complicated xD.
I'm glad I went that route because I ended up being pretty pressed for time.

I added the twitter search phrases 'protect environment' and 'clean energy' in the hopes of finding tweets from both sides of the
political spectrum, I thought it would be fun to see some hatefull environmentalist bashing against a pretty tropical beach or something lol.

# Known Problems
After playing with getty I realized I could be getting so many more tweets than I am per search. So tweet variety isnt great.

I havent thuroughly tested everything, and in fact im pretty sure that if one of my getty searches yeilds no results, the app will crash.
My only contingency plan for no search hits was to use very broad search phrases.

I am not sure if I have followed or broken the user variety rule for the tweets. I didn't understand the rule, so good chance that is another problem.

# How To Improve
I really just need to learn how twitter works, learning all the twitter lingo on top of all the programing was a pain! 

I wish my code had been more generalized. More reusable. All my code files are so specific to this project and its requirements.

The biggest improvements this project needs is prettier html and css, (in the future Im going to look for tools to help with that) and better,
longer, more meaningful quotes pertaining to nature or the environment. Many of the quotes I found were just like two words and a link.
